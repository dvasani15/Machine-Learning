Project Overview:
This project focuses on predicting the types of trees growing in the Roosevelt National Forest, Colorado, based on various environmental characteristics. The dataset used for this analysis contains over half a million cartographic measurements, including tree type, shadow coverage, distance to landmarks, soil type, and local topography. The goal is to build a predictive model and gain insights into the most common tree types in the forest, as well as their sensitivity to environmental factors.

Unsupervised Learning:
The report begins by introducing unsupervised learning, a machine learning technique that allows models to identify patterns in unlabeled data independently. It highlights clustering as a key concept in unsupervised learning, and mentions the use of K-Means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for data exploration.

Data Preprocessing:
The report explains the data preprocessing steps, such as creating new features like 'Distance_To_Hydrology,' relabeling categorical data for improved interpretability, and feature scaling to ensure numerical variables are on a similar scale as categorical variables.

Clustering and Visualization:
It discusses the creation of three clusters using K-Means Clustering and the visualization of these clusters using PCA in 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D space. The report emphasizes the effectiveness of visualizing clusters using more principal components for better insights.

WEKA Comparison:
The report mentions a comparison with the WEKA machine learning tool, highlighting potential variations in results due to differences in dataset size.

Supervised Machine Learning:
It introduces supervised machine learning, explaining its use for predicting outcomes using labeled training data. Random Forest, a widely used algorithm for classification and regression problems, is discussed.

Random Forest Implementation:
The report presents the implementation of the Random Forest algorithm in Python, including data reading, model training, and evaluation. It also mentions a comparison with the WEKA output.

Conclusion:
The project's conclusions highlight the achieved accuracy of the Random Forest model and emphasize the importance of using the entire dataset for better evaluation. It also mentions the similarity in accuracy between the Python and WEKA outputs.
